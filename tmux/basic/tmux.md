# Tmux

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, or in other words, you can run several terminal sessions in one terminal and switch between them or even place them in one window, as well as disconnect from the session, leaving it running in the background, and then return and see the result, this can be very handy when working over SSH. If you have used the screen utility before, then tmux is its counterpart, which has many more functions.
